## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: See sorting algorithms in action.
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Watch each step of the sorting process.
- **Real-Time Comparisons**: Compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and understand.

## Getting Started

To get started with Sortify, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/KaderCh/Sortify/releases). After downloading, follow the instructions to set it up on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic understanding of sorting algorithms (optional)

### Installation

1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/KaderCh/Sortify/releases).
2. **Extract** the downloaded file.
3. **Open** the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Use

Using Sortify is simple. Follow these steps:

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms available in the dropdown menu.
2. **Set Parameters**: Adjust the array size and speed of sorting.
3. **Click Start**: Hit the start button to see the sorting in action.
4. **Observe**: Watch how the algorithm sorts the array step-by-step.

## Sorting Algorithms

Sortify visualizes a variety of sorting algorithms. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each:

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the list is sorted.

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element from the input data and finds the appropriate location within the sorted part of the array.

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

### Radix Sort

Radix Sort processes the digits of the numbers from the least significant to the most significant. It uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

## Technologies Used

Sortify uses a combination of technologies to provide a seamless experience:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms and animations.
- **Canvas API**: For rendering the visualizations.
